Project Title: Random Dog Image Viewer

Project Description: The Random Dog Image Viewer is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to view random images of dogs. The frontend of the application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it will communicate with a public API that provides random dog images. The app will fetch data from the API asynchronously using JSON as the communication format and display the images on the page. Users will have the option to refresh and get a new random dog image by clicking a button. Additionally, users can click on a specific dog image to see more details about the dog breed.

Project Requirements:
1.	The app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API.
2.	The public API should provide random images of dogs.
3.	The API should return a collection of at least 5 objects, each object representing a different dog image and having at least 3 attributes: breed, imageURL, and description.
4.	All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously using the fetch() function.
5.	The app should run on a single page without redirects or reloads, contained within a single HTML file.
6.	Use at least 2 distinct event listeners of different types for interactivity. For example, you can have a button click event and an image click event.
7.	Implement array iteration using available array methods (e.g., forEach, map, or filter) to manipulate the API data and display it in different ways.
8.	Follow good coding practices to keep the code DRY by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
