Project Title: Random Dog Image Viewer

Project Description: The Random Dog Image Viewer is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to view random images of dogs. The frontend of the application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it will communicate with a public API that provides random dog images. The app will fetch data from the API asynchronously using JSON as the communication format and display the images on the page. Users will have the option to refresh and get a new random dog image by clicking a button. Additionally, users can click on a specific dog image to see more details about the dog breed.

Project Requirements:
1.	The app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API.
2.	The public API should provide random images of dogs.
3.	The API should return a collection of at least 5 objects, each object representing a different dog image and having at least 3 attributes: breed, imageURL, and description.
4.	All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously using the fetch() function.
5.	The app should run on a single page without redirects or reloads, contained within a single HTML file.
6.	Use at least 2 distinct event listeners of different types for interactivity. For example, you can have a button click event and an image click event.
7.	Implement array iteration using available array methods (e.g., forEach, map, or filter) to manipulate the API data and display it in different ways.
8.	Follow good coding practices to keep the code DRY by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Project Components:
1.	index.html: This file will contain the HTML structure of the application, including a header, main content area, and a button to fetch a new random dog image.
2.	styles.css: This CSS file will style the application's elements to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.
3.	index.js: This JavaScript file will handle the interactivity and API communication for the application.

Project Steps:
1.	Set up the HTML structure with necessary elements like the header, main content area, and a button to fetch data.
2.	Create a CSS file to style the application components.
3.	Write the JavaScript code to fetch data from the public API asynchronously using the fetch() function.
4.	Implement event listeners to handle user interactions, such as clicking the button to fetch a new random dog image and clicking on a specific image to view more details about the dog breed.
5.	Use array iteration methods to manipulate the API data and display it on the page.
6.	Organize the code using functions to keep it DRY and follow good coding practices.
7.	Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and handles different scenarios gracefully.
8.	Deploy the application and share it with others for feedback.
